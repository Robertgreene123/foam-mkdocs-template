- learn to do all tasks longhand and gain an understanding of what you are doing and what the results should look like without using design aids or computers.

 - never use a computer program to do calculations in an area you do not understand. And always study what the program says it does and compare its results to what you would expect.

 - once you have done this, use computers with caution questioning the results and comparing to your understanding of how it should work and what the results should be.

- stop reading and do some fucking work.
